# Securing a Scholarship + ID Check

## The Apply

Applying for the scholarship at 42 School was an exhausting and lengthy process. My anxiety reached its peak during this period. I filled out the application form, and the results were expected to be released in two weeks. When the results were finally out, I was not selected. Feeling disheartened, I stopped checking my email for about three days.

## The Email That Could Have Changed Everything

However, after those three days, I found an email from 42 School. They informed me that I needed to submit just one more document because there had been a dropout in the selection, and I was next in line. The deadline for submitting the document was until 1 PM on that same day. But, since I hadn’t checked my email for three days… well, I missed the scholarship.

I sent a message around 10 AM asking if it was still possible to submit the document, but I made the same mistake and only remembered to check my email at 4 PM that day. They had responded at 12 PM, saying I could submit the document until 2 PM… I lost the scholarship for good. **Huge mistake.**

## First Pool

For my first pool I didn't apply because I didn’t believe I met the prerequisites. I had never succeeded in getting something like this before, so I had zero hope or expectations of actually getting the scholarship. Even when I sent the email asking if there was still time, I thought they would say no. **Huge mistake.**

## Conclusion

Check your emails! Apply for the scholarship! They want you to participate and will do everything possible to help you with this! Even if your scholarship is initially denied, keep an eye on your email for the next three days; there might be a dropout, and you could get in. This all happened between the 30th, 31st, and 1st of the month.

## The Adventure of ID Check

After this, I had the immense adventure of going to the 42 School headquarters for ID Check, taking a photo, and verifying my identity. As you know, I live 7 hours away by bus from the 42 School headquarters… What a mission!

### The Journey

The registration was scheduled to start at 2 PM and end at 5 PM. There’s only one bus per day from my city to the capital and vice versa. What did I do? I took the bus at 6:30 AM. I arrived in the capital at 1:30 PM, had lunch, and headed to the headquarters, which was only a 5-minute drive from the bus station so I just took an Uber and then went to got in line for ID Check. I completed the whole procedure (arriving at the headquarters, climbing the immense building, waiting in line for ID Check, ID Checked, and returning to the bus station) by 3 PM. I bought my return ticket for 4:10 PM to a neighboring city of mine. I arrived in the neighboring city at 9:30 PM, took a taxi to my city, which was another hour away (there were no more local buses). I got home at 10:30 PM, had dinner, took a bath, and only managed to sleep at 3 AM.

### Expenses

- Round trip bus ticket + Meals + Transportation to and from the headquarters + Taxi to my city: R$368.10

Total: R$368.10. It was indeed a mission, but a mission completed.

## Never Give Up on Your Goals

For everything, there is a way. Planning is always key; don’t leave anything to the last minute. Since I secured my spot in the 42 School Pool, I planned my finances, transportation routes on the dates they needed my presence, accommodation, and meals well in advance. It’s possible!
